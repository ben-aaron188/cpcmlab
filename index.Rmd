# Computational Psychology and Computational Methods Lab
### *Understanding Human Behaviour through Experiments, Data, and Computational Methods*

---

## About the Lab

The **Computational Psychology and Computational Methods Lab (CPCM Lab)** focuses on the use of computational approaches to study the human mind and behaviour.  

Our work is cross-disciplinary and seeks to answer two questions: 

1. **How can computational methods enhance our understanding of the human mind and behaviour?**
2. **How can psychological research methods inform our understanding of computational model behaviour?**

We collect data in **psychological experiments** and develop and apply techniques from **natural language processing**, **machine learning**, and **statistical modelling** to better understand human behaviour and psychological processes.

Our lab brings together researchers with backgrounds in **Psychology, Computer Science, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, Mathematics, Law,** and **Cognitive Science**.  


The CPCM Lab is based at the [Department of Methodology and Statistics](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/socialsciences/organization/departments/methodology-statistics) at Tilburg University.

*Assessing the artificial mind through the marriage of natural language processing and psychometrics*

My project is focused on understanding generative language models through psychological measurement frameworks. My work focuses on if – and how – psychometric approaches can be used to validly assess the behaviour of these models

*Computational methods to measure, understand, and influence prosocial behavior and trust*

In our project, we apply and develop methods and tools to measure and model the dynamics of trust and prosocial behaviors - individually and at scale. Also, we explore how LLMs, apps, and other technologies, as well as humans, can actively influence these behaviors in potentially harmful or potentially constructive directions.

*Text-mining methods for theory development in psychological and social science research*

My PhD project develops text mining methods to automatically detect and parse causal claims in social science texts. It turns unstructured prose into structured who-causes-what representations and encodes them as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). This lets researchers identify recurring causal patterns, generate testable hypotheses, and conduct transparent evidence synthesis and theory refinement.

*Decoding distorted interpretations of ambiguity from text data*

Everyday life is full of ambiguous social situations, and biased / inflexible interpretations of these situations are linked to depression and anxiety. Our work focuses on leveraging linguistic indicators of interpretation processes to improve understanding, measurement, and intervention methods that are more ecologically valid and translatable to real-world mental health.

## Research

The CPCM Lab investigates how **computational methods can enhance our understanding of the human mind and behaviour**, and how **psychological research can inform our understanding of computational models**.

### Research Themes

#### Deception Detection
- Integrating experimental data and computational methods to address the "hard problems" of deception research
- Examining how human adversarial machine learning can inform cognitive deception theory


#### Methodological advancements
Developing the methods needed to advance computational psychology research

- Secure and scalable methods for text anonymisation (e.g., [Textwash](https://github.com/ben-aaron188/textwash))
- Sample size estimation algorithms for supervised machine learning


#### Machine Beahviour
- Understanding stochastic humanness of large language models through experimental research
- Using formal psychometric modelling to study the behaviour of artificial intelligence models and how it reflects or diverges from human behaviour and cognition.


#### Computational Psychology with Natural Language Processing

Using computational text analysis to study and predict psychological constructs in humans (e.g., cynicism, emotion, deception)

## Joining the lab

_How can I join the CPCM lab?_ 

Lab members are typically postdocs, PhD students, thesis students or research interns/assistants. **Thesis projects** are advertised in the programmes we are involved in. There are various routes for **PhD projects** (e.g., a funded position via university employment, a joint PhD with another university, self-funding). All positions that are connected to employment (typically for 4 years) are publicly advertised. If you are interested in a **research internship**, please identify a topic you are interested in that aligns with the lab's focus and is relevant to at least one other lab member. Reach out to Bennett via email then. Research internships should last at least 6 months since projects require a solid embedding in psychological research and computational methods..
